# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Friendly & Community-Focused:** The content should sound like it's coming from a neighbor you can trust. Use warm, approachable language that emphasizes our deep roots in the Algonquin community.
- **Relatable:** Avoid overly complex technical jargon when explaining services, focusing instead on how we help the customer get back on the road safely.
- **Helpful:** The primary goal of the prose is to guide and inform the user, providing clear answers to their auto repair and tire needs.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & High-Tech:** Leverage the existing technology stack (Astro, Tailwind CSS, GSAP) to create a sleek, contemporary user experience.
- **Dynamic & Engaging:** Use smooth transitions and subtle animations (via GSAP and Lenis) to make the interface feel responsive and high-end.
- **Clean Layouts:** Maintain a professional and organized look that makes information easy to find and digest.
- **Local Context:** Incorporate imagery and design elements that resonate with the Algonquin, IL area to reinforce our local presence.

## Brand Messaging
- **Convenience First:** Consistently highlight our accessibility for Algonquin residents and those in neighboring cities like Barrington, Cary, and Crystal Lake.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Build confidence by emphasizing our commitment to honest assessments, clear pricing, and high-quality workmanship.
